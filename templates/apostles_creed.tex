Confess our Faith -- Apostle's Creed \\
	\vspace{.4em}
\begin{leftbar}
I believe in God the Father Almighty;\\
Maker of heaven and earth, \\
and in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord.\\
He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, \\
and born of the virgin, Mary. \\
He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, \\
and was buried. He descended into Hades.\\
On the third day He rose again, from the dead, ascended into\\
Heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;\\ 
from thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.\\
I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy catholic Church, \\
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,\\
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
